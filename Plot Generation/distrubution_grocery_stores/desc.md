From the graph, we can see that most of the produce box distribution sites (green dots) are in regions where SVI scores are high. These regions are most vulnerable to not having access to healthy food. Although there are many grocery stores throughout Baltimore, they often do not cover areas where they are most necessary. Our distribution sites help alleviate the pressure of not having a nearby grocery store in those regions by providing nutritious produce to the residents. For example, the largest distribution sites are in the East Baltimore area, one of the most vulnerable areas where most residents live far away from grocery stores. These sites give residents easier access to fresh produce to fulfill their nutritional needs.
